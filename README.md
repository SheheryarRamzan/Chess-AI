# Chess-AI
Explore the world of chess with an intelligent AI player built using the Minimax algorithm. This open-source repository focuses on developing a strategic chess engine that can evaluate positions, perform deep searches, and make optimal moves based on the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning

Welcome to our Chess AI project, powered by the Minimax algorithm! Our goal is to develop an intelligent and strategic chess engine that can evaluate board positions and make optimal moves to challenge and improve your chess skills.

Features:

Minimax Algorithm: The engine employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient search and evaluation of possible moves.

Smart Evaluation: Advanced board evaluation functions help the AI player make informed decisions, optimizing gameplay.

Interactive Interface: Experience the AI's moves and decisions in real-time through a user-friendly interface.
